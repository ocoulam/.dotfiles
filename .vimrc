# Problems Encountered: There were two main problems I encountered. The first was managing and modifying the VIM text editing system (it took some adjustment to use the insert and visual capabilities, as well as the commands for saving and quitting). The second was copying and renameing the file to my desktop, since my local machine is my Macbook and I'm using SSH access into a Lab 1D43 computer. I used the login "sftp" and the command "get .vimrc" to copy the file to my macbook, then I was able to use the "cp" command to reroute the file to the desktop and rename it.
